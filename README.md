Image Translation API with Flask



This project provides a simple Flask-based backend that allows you to translate an image based on instructions using the Hugging Face Inference API. It specifically utilizes the timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix model, which can edit images based on text commands.

Features

Image-to-Image Translation: Upload an image and get a modified version based on the model's capabilities.

Hugging Face Integration: Leverages the timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix model from the Hugging Face Hub.

Simple API Endpoint: Offers a single POST endpoint /translate for easy integration and use.

Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Installation

Clone the repository (or save the script):

Generated bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>


Install the required Python libraries:

Generated bash
pip install Flask requests

Configuration

Obtain a Hugging Face API Token:
To use the Hugging Face Inference API, you need an API token. You can generate one from your Hugging Face account settings.

Update the API Token in the script:
Open the app.py file and replace the placeholder API_TOKEN with your actual Hugging Face API token:

Generated python
API_TOKEN = "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"  # Replace with your valid token

Usage

Run the Flask application:

Generated bash
python app.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The application will launch in debug mode and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Send a request to the API:
You can use any tool capable of sending HTTP requests, such as curl or Postman, to interact with the API. You must send a POST request with a multipart/form-data payload containing the image.

Example using curl:

Generated bash
curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/translate \
  -F 'image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg'

Replace /path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path to your image file.

Expected Response

Success:
If the image is processed successfully, you will receive a JSON response containing a URL to the translated image:

Generated json
{
  "url": "URL_to_the_translated_image"
}
